Contiguous Subarrays
You are given an array arr of N integers. For each index i, you are required to determine the number of contiguous subarrays that fulfill the following conditions:
The value at index i must be the maximum element in the contiguous subarrays, and
These contiguous subarrays must either start from or end on index i.
Signature
int[] countSubarrays(int[] arr)
Input
Array arr is a non-empty list of unique integers that range between 1 to 1,000,000,000
Size N is between 1 and 1,000,000
Output
An array where each index i contains an integer denoting the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of arr[i]
